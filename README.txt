Thank you for using the Lowrie Hand Finder.

To use this utility, run the .exe file and follow the text prompt to enter the cards you have in your deck.
Card input should be as follows:
 - Two characters representing the face value and its suit (for 10s, this will be three characters)
 - Face values that are non-numeric (Ace through Jack) will be A, K, Q, J, in order. Enter face values as upper case.
 - Face values that are numeric should enter their number value directly.
 - Suits (c, d, h, s) should be entered as lower case.
 - Entered cards do not need to be sorted, so enter the cards in any order that you prefer.
 
Aces are considered high when calculating high card.
"Through" Straights (K-A-2-3-4 for example) are not considered a hand in this version.
